# Todolist Application
This application is a simple Todo List application. It is made as a project for my developer portfolio, to show my skills in different technologies and software architecturing.

It has a web API which can communicate with the different frontend applications. this repository therefore consists of the backend which has a web API coded with `.NET 7`, and the frontend which consists of a `React.JS` web application which consumes from the API

The backend Web API can be a standalone application though, which you then can wire up with your own frontend.
